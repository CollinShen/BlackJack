# BlackJack
I made BlackJack in python for fun! IG is @cshen.stem to see the process and thinking. I fully expect to look back at this one day and cringe at inefficiencies or weird nuances, but hey thats how we grow right? we all start somewhere. any and ALL bugs please feel free to notify me. Thank you for looking at this! :)
Yeah, I know it's not super complicated, you can run this in IDLE, I'm not sure why sometimes it bugs out in VS code, but if you find a way to allow it to run 
universally in many programs, go for it! all code is free for use.
